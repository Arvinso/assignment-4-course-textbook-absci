The following course textbook is written in Tex/Latex. You need not know Latex to edit the document.

If you are inclined to compile the Latex into a pdf please use Texstudio software to do so. Compared to the alternative Latex compilers/viewers it is a godsend.

Note that *all* sources need to be cited, unless the writing *and* examples are your own.

It is recommended to use the slides to fill in various sections.
